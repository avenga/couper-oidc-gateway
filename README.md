# Couper OIDC Gateway

A ready to use [Couper](https://github.com/avenga/couper) image to spin up an OpenID Connect gateway.

`docker pull avenga/couper-oidc-gateway`

_coming soon_

The gateway uses the Authorization Code Grant Flow to connect to an OpenID Provider.

The redirect endpoint for the flow is `/_couper/oidc/callback`.

You need to register a **confidential** client at the OpenID Provider with the redirect URI `https://<your-gateway-host>/_couper/oidc/callback`. During registration you get a client ID and a client secret.
